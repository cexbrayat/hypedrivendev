      <description>Hey, hello there!
 It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I wrote something on my personal blog (as you may know I was busy writing an ebook about Angular).
 My old blog was using Wordpress, and I was not really into going back there :). The blog of Ninja Squad is using Jekyll, and even if it works great, I&amp;#8217;m a bit tired of it.
 So the first task was to look for a new static blog generator.</description>
